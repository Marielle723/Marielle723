### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marielle, I am fresh out of a JS, React and React Native bootcamp, ready for some challenges. On my way to become a skilled fullstack developer, I am currently building my portfolio and improving my coding skills. I also love litterature and writing about the books I read. I cannot wait to build bigger projects where creativity and logics makes our web navigation experiences prettier and easier.
